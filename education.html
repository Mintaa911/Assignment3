                        The secret of getting ahead is getting started. <br>
                        The secret of getting started is breaking your <br>
                        complex overwhelming tasks into small manageable <br>
                        tasks, and then starting on the first one. <br>

                        Aim for success, not perfection. Never give up your right <br>
                        to be wrong, because then you will lose the ability to learn <br>
                        new things and move forward with your life. Remember that <br>
                        fear always lurks behind perfectionism. <br>

                    <q>
                        We can easily manage if we will only take, each day, <br>
                         the burden appointed to it. But the load will be too <br>
                         heavy for us if we carry yesterday’s burden over again <br>
                         today, and then add the burden of the morrow before <br>
                         we are required to bear it. <br>

                        The aim of education should be to teach us rather how to think, <br>
                        than what to think — rather to improve our minds, so as to enable <br>
                        us to think for ourselves, than to load the memory with thoughts of other men. <br>
