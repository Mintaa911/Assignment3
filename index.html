                                I'm Mintesnot Bezabhi. I live in Ethiopia, one of the uncolnised 
                                country in the world. I'm 21 years old. I'm a Software Engineering
                                I was born from my father Bezabhi Lemu and my mother Almaz Gero. 
                                I have two brothers Yilkal and Yididiya. I love my family a lot.

                                Addis Ababa is the best univerity in our country. I'm lucky to 
                                be a student in this univerity. Software Engineering is one of 
                                the most wanted field of study in college. These is because the
                                world is in the era of technology. So, tech people are needed 
                                for work in this amazing world.
